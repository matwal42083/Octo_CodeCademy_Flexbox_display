# Codecademy Contribute Project
# Repo Name: Octo_CodeCademy_Flexbox_display
Codecademy Flexbox display contribution project, 
for students to contribute to the fullstack engineering career path 

> [!WARNING]
> Only for Codecademy Pro Fullstack


### What is the project?
It's a flexbox display for all the flexbox tricks Codecademy teaches in the fullstack 
engineer's career path. I started this to get a better understanding of Flexbox techniques.
Once I started this I realized quickly that this could be a big project for all fullstack 
student engineers at Codecademy as a contributor project to help them get the experience that 
they need and a way to contribute to a project and be able to add the experience to their resume as
their own.



### What is the project for?
The project is for students like me, you, and future students to have a visual cheat
sheet for Flexbox so everybody can see what exactly is going on when you Flexbox out a layout.
Codecademy doesn't have one of these that I know of, but they can if we the students build it for ourselves, using the 
skills that we have learned on Codecademy this is the perfect project for hands-on skills to learning new skills together, 
contributing together, work as a team as well

### What the Project looks like:
 1. The project layout - Is a flexbox layout itself and can get very confusing very quickly and overwhelming as well

 2. The Project content items - The content will be going into the boxes in the main flexbox layout aka box items.
    As you can see and figure out quickly this project is Flexbox into Flexbox.

### What in it for me?
 1. To get a very good understanding of Flexbox and how to do it correctly and ethically.
 2. To gain contributing experience as a Fullstack engineer, learn hands-on skills, and deepen your knowledge of contributing skills with this experience.
 3. To be able to say that you contribute to a coding project before on your resume and use me as a reference in your job hunt later on.
 4. To gain the ability to work with others remotely and to gain that experience as well as eliminate the fear of what going to be expected of you on your first job or your next contributor project.
 6. To get comfortable with the career role or path that you are learning as of now.
 7. We are Fullstack developers and engineers and this is what we do, contribute to communities that we belong to or have an understanding of.
